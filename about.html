    <p> I'm a 40-ish ex-professional printer and reading enthusiast whose dream is to get paid for what I actually want to do, read!

        I have quite eclectic tastes, however my favorite genre since a child has been Fantasy, starting off with Enid Blytons' Magic Faraway Tree novels and working my way through most of the fantasy greats, with my favorite being the huge Wheel of Time series. I like big books and I cannot lie.
